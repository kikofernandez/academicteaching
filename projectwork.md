# Introduction

Information technology is an ever changing field where things that were a standard
a few years ago may be seem as bad practise or even harmful nowadays. In this regard,
the *Unified Modelling Language* (UML) is a language that provides a visual
understanding of software under design. The main selling point of a visual modelling
language is to display a visual overview that can be understood by software engineers
and stakeholders as well as to avoid starting the implementation phase without
a good design.

Uppsala University offers the course Advanced Software Design, imparted by
Francisco Fernandez Reyes, using an achievement-driven learning process.
The main objective of the course is to design complex software systems, using
UML as the main tool to achieve this. However, we have observed that the students miss
the connection between UML and an implementation in code. This observation
coincides with recent studies [@DBLP:journals/vlc/GravinoST15], where researchers
show that the connection between the conceptual model and the code is misunderstood by
programmers who are not experience in UML.

There are studies [@DBLP:journals/ese/Fernandez-SaezG16] that show
that the details of UML (high or low) do not matter much
once there is a clear understanding of the diagrams. However, empirically,
and over a course of 15 years, [@DBLP:conf/icse/Chaudron17] found that industry
uses UML as a way of communicating high-level concepts rather than small details.
There are also efforts [@DBLP:journals/jss/OriolT17] on simplifying the schemas,
which will avoid errors during the development phase.
